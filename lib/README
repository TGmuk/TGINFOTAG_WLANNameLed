MBED Libs that end with .lib are only compiled on Keil Studio and not on PlatformIO.
You need to download or copy the "real" content of the lib to this directory.



The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
|  |
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.c
|  |     |- Bar.h
|  |  |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.c
|  |  |- Foo.h
|  |
|  |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
   |- main.c
